# 🛡️ SOC Readiness: Daily Technical Audit Trail
**Name:** Vishvdeep Singh Bal, CC  

## 📋 Why this Audit Trail?
In Cybersecurity, documentation is as critical as technical execution. This repository serves as a centralized "Central Source of Truth" for my daily growth, capturing insights from:

* **Hands-on Labs:** Building and defending enterprise-grade environments in the **Josh Madakor Cyber Range**.
* **Certification Tracks:** Daily progress through **CompTIA Security+** and **ISC2 CC** domains.
* **Mentorship:** High-level strategic sessions with **RiskStifle** on firewall logic and security audits.
* **Industry Intelligence:** Insights from daily cyber news, threat reports, and industry podcasts (e.g., Darknet Diaries, CyberWire).
* **Tool Mastery:** Documentation of my evolving stack: Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM), Defender (EDR), Azure AD, and Tenable.

## 🗓️ February 2026 Logs

### 📍 Saturday, Feb 21, 2026 — Day 1: Foundation & Identity
**Focus:** Firewall & Vulnerability Management Theory & Professional Identity Engineering

#### 🏗️ Theoretical Deep Dive (06:00 - 10:00)
* **Firewall Logic:** Studied Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) architecture with a focus on **Fortigate**.
* **Audit Principles:** Explored the relationship between security audits, internal controls, and Firewall Audits.
* **Enterprise Connectivity:** Analyzed how firewall policy logic governs traffic flow in regulated sectors.

#### 💻 Portfolio & Architecture Engineering
* **GitHub Hub:** Initialized the `vishvdeepbal-Infosec` repository as a professional portfolio.
* **Credential Validation:** Integrated verified links for **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** and **Forage simulations** (AIG, Deloitte, Mastercard).
* **Project Roadmapping:** Defined the **Vulnerability Management** lifecycle (Discover, Prioritize, Remediate, Verify).
* **Architecture Design:** Finalized the high-level design for the **Cyber Range** lab, identifying the integration points between Azure, Tenable, and EDR endpoints.

  ### 📍 Sunday, Feb 22, 2026 — Day 2: The Multi-Source Learning Loop
**Focus:** Vulnerability Theory & Cloud Infrastructure Prep

 ### 🏗️ Project 1: Vulnerability Management (Azure + Tenable)
Status: Initialized Phase 1 (Theory & Scoping).

Activity: Deep-dive into the NIST Vulnerability Management Life Cycle.

Generalization: Researching how Tenable concepts translate to Rapid7 and Qualys to maintain a "product-agnostic" mindset.

Cloud Prep: Reviewing Azure Resource Group naming conventions for the "Cyber Range" student VMs.

📚 Security+ & Certification Prep
Domain Focus: Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities.

Concept Mastery: Reinforced the difference between "Vulnerabilities" (weaknesses) and "Threats" (actors who exploit them), aligning this with the practical lab work in Tenable.

🧠 Analyst Key Takeaway
"A SOC Analyst doesn't just look at a dashboard; they look at the world. Sunday was about connecting Security+ theory to the Cyber Range labs, ensuring my technical actions are informed by current threat intelligence."

📍 Monday, Feb 23, 2026 — Day 3: Strategic Theory & Baseline Assessment
Focus: Security+ Domain 1 & Industry Intelligence

📚 Security+ SY0-701 Certification Prep
Resource Confirmation: Finalized the 2026 study stack using Inside Cloud and Security (Exam Cram series), Professor Messer, and Crucial Exams.

Baseline Assessment: Completed a baseline practice exam via Crucial Exams and Professor Messer’s Pop Quizzes.

Objective: Identify knowledge gaps in Domain 1 (General Security Concepts) before continuing Azure implementation.

Domain 1 Deep-Dive: Focused on Section 1.1: Security Control Categories.

Technical vs. Managerial vs. Operational vs. Physical: Studied how these controls overlap.

Control Types: Mastered the differences between Deterrent, Preventive, Detective, Corrective, and Compensating controls.

🎙️ Industry Intel & News
Podcast: The CyberWire Daily (Ep 2494 | 02.23.26).

Topic: "The basics broke telecom."

Analysis: Connected the podcast's discussion on fundamental infrastructure failures to the Change Management and Operational Controls studied in Security+ today.

🧠 Analyst Key Takeaway
"Today was a 'Pivot Day.' I chose to delay the Cyber Range hands-on to focus on establishing a solid theoretical baseline for Security+. In a SOC environment, you must sometimes pause operations to ensure your fundamental knowledge of controls (Preventive vs. Detective) is 100% accurate."
