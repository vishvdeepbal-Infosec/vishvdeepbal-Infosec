# 🛡️ SOC Readiness: Daily Technical Audit Trail
**Name:** Vishvdeep Singh Bal, CC  

## 📋 Why this Audit Trail?
In Cybersecurity, documentation is as critical as technical execution. This repository serves as a centralized "Central Source of Truth" for my daily growth, capturing insights from:

* **Hands-on Labs:** Building and defending enterprise-grade environments in the **Josh Madakor Cyber Range**.
* **Certification Tracks:** Daily progress through **CompTIA Security+** and **ISC2 CC** domains.
* **Mentorship:** High-level strategic sessions with **RiskStifle** on firewall logic and security audits.
* **Industry Intelligence:** Insights from daily cyber news, threat reports, and industry podcasts (e.g., Darknet Diaries, CyberWire).
* **Tool Mastery:** Documentation of my evolving stack: Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM), Defender (EDR), Azure AD, and Tenable.
