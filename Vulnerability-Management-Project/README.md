# 🛡️ Project: Vulnerability Management & Remediation (Azure + Tenable)

## 📋 Project Objective
[cite_start]The goal of this lab is to establish a continuous vulnerability management lifecycle by deploying a **Tenable Nessus** scanner within an **Azure** environment to identify, prioritize, and remediate security risks on a "victim" workstation[cite: 12, 53].

## 🛠️ Environment & Tools
- [cite_start]**Cloud Platform:** Azure [cite: 14]
- [cite_start]**Vulnerability Scanner:** Tenable Nessus [cite: 12, 31, 53]
- [cite_start]**Target OS:** Windows 10 (Intentionally outdated/unpatched) [cite: 12]
- [cite_start]**Compliance Framework:** CIS Benchmarks

## 🚀 Lab Roadmap (In Progress)

### 1. 🏗️ Environment Setup
- Deploy a Windows 10 VM in Azure with Windows Firewall disabled to simulate a vulnerable endpoint.
- Install and configure Tenable Nessus Essentials on a dedicated scanning workstation.

### 2. 🔍 Identification (The "First Scan")
- Run an unauthenticated scan to establish a baseline.
- Configure credentialed/authenticated scans to "look under the hood" for missing patches and registry misconfigurations.

### 3. 📊 Analysis & Prioritization
- Analyze findings using **CVSS scores** (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Prioritize remediation based on exploitability and business impact.

### 4. 🛠️ Remediation & Verification
- Apply Windows updates and manual security patches.
- Perform a follow-up scan to verify a reduction in the attack surface.

## 🧠 Analyst Reflection
[cite_start]"Vulnerability management is more than just running a tool; it is about risk reduction. This lab demonstrates my ability to navigate enterprise security tools and translate technical findings into actionable remediation steps." [cite: 5, 50, 53]
