# 🛡️ Project: Vulnerability Management & Remediation (Azure + Tenable)

## 📋 Project Objective
"Currently operating within a managed Enterprise Cyber Range, performing full-lifecycle Vulnerability Management using Tenable/Nessus integrated with an Azure Enterprise environment. This project involves managing risk for a simulated mid-sized business, moving from initial discovery through tiered remediation rollouts (Pre-pilot to Production) in accordance with NIST 800-40 standards."

## 🚀 Lab Roadmap

### 1. 🏗️ Environment Setup
- Deploy a Windows 10 VM in Azure and disable Windows Firewall to simulate a vulnerable endpoint.
- Install Tenable Nessus Essentials on a dedicated scanning workstation.

### 2. 🔍 Identification (The "First Scan")
- Run an unauthenticated scan to establish a baseline.
- Configure credentialed scans to identify missing patches and registry misconfigurations.

### 3. 📊 Analysis & Prioritization
- Analyze findings using **CVSS scores** (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Prioritize remediation based on exploitability and business impact.
  
### 4. 🛠️ Remediation & Verification
- Apply Windows updates and manual security patches.
- Perform a follow-up scan to verify a reduction in the attack surface.
